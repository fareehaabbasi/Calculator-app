The calculator app is a practical, user-friendly tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases core front-end development skills, from structuring the layout with HTML to styling with CSS for a clean, modern look. JavaScript powers the app's functionality, handling user input and performing calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app includes an interactive display where users can see the results of their operations in real-time. This project serves as a solid example of integrating basic front-end technologies to create an engaging, functional application.
